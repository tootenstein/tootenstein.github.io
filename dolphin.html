				Hi, my name is Leila. I am in first grade. Can I talk to you about dolphins? Great! They are amazing creatures.
				They are man's best friend. There are almost 40 kinds of dolphins.Neat,eh? Earlyer in the day,people said it was a bad omen to kill a dolphin. Infact, people took dolphins as lucky signs. They can spin,twirl and dance!!! Spinner dolphins can spin up to 70 times! Dolphins jaws are shaped like a smile because they don't depend on facial expression while they are in the water.
